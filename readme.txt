Minimal Interaction Warfare
---------------------------

Goal:
- Destroy all the enemy units
			or
- Get at least 3 units to the enemy starting point

Game Over:
- All your units are destroyed
			or
- The enemy get's at least 3 units on your starting grid

Controls:
When the game starts, you have 1290 points which you can spend
on units (soldiers and tanks). A soldier costs 40 and a tank 100. 
Soldiers stats:
- They do high damage
- Low Health points
- Lower Range than tanks
(good for offense)

Tanks:
- They do less damage then the soldier
- Huge Health Points
- Higher Attack Range
(great for defense, stalling the enemy)

You can only place units on the lower part of the screen (first two rows)

After placing all the units on the grid, you must click the
double green arrow on the "Unit Bar" on top of the screen.

The following screen is a "Command Screen". You must select
a unit by clicking on it. If the blue arrow is selected
then that unit will enter a defend mode, when reaching the end
of the path, and will remain at that location.

If the Red Arrow is selected then, after the unit reaches the end of the
path, he will engage an enemy.

Once a unit is selected click on any position on the screen to
start a path. The path continues to generate until the "END PATH"
button is clicked. You can pass through the same tiles as many times as 
you want, thus creating a loop of paths.

In order to start the simulation you must press the double green arrows
on the upper side of the screen. ONCE THE SIMULATION IS STARTED, YOU CANNOT
DEPLOY ANY MORE ACTIONS.

Units that are given commands (move-attack, move-defend) get a stats bost.

Tips:
To set units in a "patrol" mode create a path that goes through the desired points
as many times as you want.
